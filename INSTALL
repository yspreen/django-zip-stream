************
Requirements
************

`django-zip-stream` has been tested with `Python`_ 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and pypy.
Other versions may work, but they are not part of the test suite at the moment.

Installing `django-zip-stream` will automatically trigger the installation of
the following requirements:

.. literalinclude:: /../setup.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: BEGIN requirements
   :end-before: END requirements


************
As a library
************

In most cases, you will use `django-zip-stream` as a dependency of another
project. In such a case, you should add `django-zip-stream` in your main
project's requirements. Typically in :file:`setup.py`:

.. code:: python

   from setuptools import setup

   setup(
       install_requires=[
           'django-zip-stream',
           #...
       ]
       # ...
   )

Then when you install your main project with your favorite package manager
(like `pip`_), `django-zip-stream` and its recursive dependencies will
automatically be installed.


**********
Standalone
**********

You can install `django-zip-stream` with your favorite Python package
manager. As an example with `pip`_:

.. code:: sh

   pip install django-zip-stream


*****
Check
